- Select sex for comparison (optional): Male or Female
- Choose any of the 8 available metrics
- Enter your value and instantly see your percentile

**ðŸ” Find by Name (Database Lookup)**
- Search for any radiologist in the database
- View all 8 metrics and percentiles at once
- Filter comparison group by rank and/or sex

### Available Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total Citations | All citations received across all publications |
| Total Papers | Total number of publications |
| H-Index | Hirsch index measuring productivity and citation impact |
| First Author Papers | Publications where the individual is first author |
| First Author Citations | Citations to first-author publications |
| Last Author Papers | Publications where the individual is last/senior author |
| Last Author Citations | Citations to last-author publications |
| **Yousem Metric** â˜… | Weighted productivity measure emphasizing leadership roles |

### The Yousem Metric

The Yousem Metric is a novel bibliometric measure designed to emphasize leadership roles in academic publishing, where first and last authorship positions indicate greater contribution and responsibility.

**Formula:**
```
Yousem Metric = Weighted Citations + (10 Ã— Weighted Papers)
```

**Weighting System:**
- **First Author** positions: **5Ã— weight** (led the research)
- **Last/Senior Author** positions: **5Ã— weight** (supervised the research)
- **Middle Author** positions: **1Ã— weight** (contributed to the research)

This metric rewards researchers who lead projects (first author) or supervise them (last/senior author), providing a more nuanced view of academic contribution than simple publication or citation counts.

## Data Source

All bibliometric data were derived from **Scopus** database searches conducted in **November 2025**.

The dataset includes:
- Faculty from U.S. academic radiology departments
- Three academic ranks: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor
- Publication and citation data with authorship position analysis

## How to Use

1. Open either calculator HTML file in any web browser
2. Choose your preferred mode:
   - **Manual Entry**: Enter your own values to see where you rank
   - **Name Lookup**: Search for someone in the database
3. Optionally filter by academic rank and/or sex to compare against a specific peer group
4. View your percentile results with visual progress bars

## Technical Notes
